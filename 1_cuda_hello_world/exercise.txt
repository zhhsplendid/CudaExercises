Implement a cuda kernel prints

"Hello world from GPU xxx"

from each thread, the xxx can be an ID to distinguish each thread.

Launch it with multi block and multi thread, for example, 10 * 10

Note:
To print it on console, you may need some synchronization on CPU,
otherwise you cannot see the strings on your console.  

Label:
basic CUDA block/thread index
synchronization
