# CudaExercises

## Introduce
This is a repo of some cuda exercises, just like CUDA Leetcode.
I will collect some cuda problems and optimization tips for CUDA.
Hope it will be helpful to open source readers.

这是一个CUDA练习repo，就像CUDA Leetcode。
我会收集一些CUDA练习和优化技巧。
希望可以开源帮助相关读者。

## How to use it?
Each folder in this repo contains a question.
In each folder, we provide:
- An exercise.txt to describe the problem.
- A cuda_exercise.cu as example code.
- A run_cuda.sh to help readers to focus on cuda code, not compilation, build, etc.
- (Optional) a README.txt to explain the tips in this problem.

To run the CUDA code in the folder, go to the folder and run run_cuda.sh, for example:
```
cd 1_cuda_hello_world
bash run_cuda.sh
```
